## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I saw the very importance of a savy knowledge of media query in building responsive websites. While it was not as challenging building for mobile first, I found it challenging having to adapt the designs for larger screen sizes with their different widths and sizes.

### Continued development

This project has reinforced my need to go back to the learning stead of understanding media queries and adept skill in responsive website programming.
Also the need to further my development in understanding in depth the concept of the different layouts,, and the best use cases of each.
